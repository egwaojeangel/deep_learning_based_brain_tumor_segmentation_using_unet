## Overview  
#Overview #MedicalImagingAI #Segmentation
This project presents a deep learning–based brain tumor segmentation system implemented using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The system is built around the **U-Net architecture**, a well-established convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation.

The implementation focuses on **pixel-level tumor segmentation** from 2D MRI slices extracted from the **BraTS 2021 dataset**, using the **FLAIR modality**. Rather than conducting a full clinical study, this project emphasizes **correct implementation, training stability, evaluation, and reproducibility** of a modern medical image segmentation pipeline.

Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Manual delineation by radiologists is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability, motivating the use of automated deep learning–based solutions.

## Dataset  
#Dataset #BraTS #MedicalDatasets
This project uses the **BraTS 2021 (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge)** dataset, a widely adopted benchmark in medical imaging research.

### Dataset Characteristics  
#DatasetDetails
- Multi-institutional MRI scans  
- Expert-annotated tumor segmentation masks  
- Multiple MRI modalities (FLAIR, T1, T1ce, T2)  

### Modality Used in This Project  
#FLAIR #MRIModality
**FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery)**  
Chosen due to its strong contrast for highlighting tumor-associated edema.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Due to size and licensing restrictions, the BraTS dataset is not included in this repository.

## Data Preparation & Split  
#DataSplit #Preprocessing
- Patient-level split to prevent data leakage  
- Training: 70%  
- Validation: 15%  
- Testing: 15%  

Only **2D slices containing tumor regions** were selected for training and evaluation, improving class balance and segmentation relevance.

## Methodology  
#Methodology #DeepLearningPipeline

### Image Preprocessing  
#ImagePreprocessing
- Slice extraction from 3D NIfTI volumes  
- Min–max intensity normalization  
- Resizing to **96 × 96 pixels**  
- Binary mask generation (tumor vs. background)  

Each MRI slice is treated as a **single-channel (grayscale)** input.

### Data Augmentation (Training Only)  
#DataAugmentation #Generalization
To improve generalization, the following augmentations were applied:

- Horizontal flipping  
- Vertical flipping  
- Random 90° rotations  

Augmentations were applied consistently to both images and masks to preserve spatial alignment.

## Model Architecture

### U-Net  
The model is based on the original **U-Net architecture**, consisting of:

**Encoder (Contracting Path):**  
- Stacked convolutional blocks  
- Batch normalization  
- ReLU activations  
- Max-pooling for spatial downsampling  

**Decoder (Expanding Path):**  
- Bilinear upsampling  
- Skip connections from encoder layers  
- Feature concatenation for spatial detail recovery  

**Output:**  
- 1×1 convolution  
- Sigmoid activation  
- Binary segmentation mask (tumor / non-tumor)

## Training Details  
#Training #Optimization #PyTorch
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCELoss)  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-3

### Training Stability Techniques  
#TrainingStability #Reproducibility
- Gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)  
- Mid-epoch checkpoint saving  
- Automatic resume from last checkpoint  
- Best-model tracking based on validation Dice score  

---

## Evaluation Metrics  
#EvaluationMetrics #MedicalSegmentation
The model was evaluated using standard segmentation metrics:

- Dice Coefficient (primary metric)  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall (Sensitivity)  
- Specificity  
- F1 Score  

Dice score was prioritized due to its robustness for class-imbalanced segmentation tasks.

## Checkpointing & Reproducibility  
#Checkpointing #Reproducibility
The training pipeline includes:

- `latest_checkpoint.pth` – latest training state  
- `best_model.pth` – best model based on validation Dice score  

Training can be safely resumed after interruption without loss of progress.

## Relation to Existing Research  
#RelatedWork #ResearchContext
U-Net–based architectures remain a dominant baseline for brain tumor segmentation tasks. Recent studies continue to demonstrate their effectiveness on BraTS datasets, particularly when combined with careful preprocessing and evaluation strategies (Isensee et al., 2021; Hatamizadeh et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).

This project aligns with these works by implementing a clean, reproducible U-Net pipeline, serving as a strong baseline for future extensions.

## Limitations  
#Limitations #ResearchChallenges
- Uses 2D slice-based segmentation instead of full 3D volumes  
- Single MRI modality (FLAIR only)  
- No clinical validation or expert radiologist review  
- No explainability or uncertainty estimation

## Future Work  
#FutureWork #ResearchDirections
- Extend to 3D U-Net or nnU-Net  
- Incorporate multi-modal MRI inputs  
- Add Dice + Focal loss combinations  
- Integrate explainability methods  
- Deploy as a clinical decision support prototype  
- Validate with expert radiologist annotations
